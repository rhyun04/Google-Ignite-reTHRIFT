# my_app

Creation of flutter application for the Google Ignite program 2022. 

## Project Description 
Title: reTHRIFT 

## Summary 
In this project, we have developed a minimal viable product (MVP) of the application - reTHRIFT. 
reTHRIFT is an application that uses google API and firebase to integrate google maps into the platform.

## How to run project

$ flutter clean
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter run

## Future Work 
We are looking to expand into creating recommendations for the user with every thrift shop they view, 
work as a GPS in the application and mitigate hardcoded shops to firebase. 
For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
